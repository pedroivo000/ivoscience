## Hello World!

This is the ~~obligatory~~ first post ever on this blog!

I was bored one day writing my research paper and decided that I needed a more productive and useful way to procastinate, so here we are. I might not make much sense to procastinate writing with more writing, but I plan on using this blog to practice my Data Science, programming and scientific writing/communication skills and as a way of uniting my love for data analysis to my many other interests such as gaming and Esports (Overwatch FTW), Bioinformatics and Biology. The more I write, the better I'll get! 

And in the spirit of practicing my R coding skills, I decided to write all the content for the blog using R Markdown and the package `blogdown`! `blogdown` is [an amazing R package](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) developed by Yihui Xie that provides everything needed to create a static website (like a blog), from selecting a theme from the static website generator [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) to deplyoing your site to *THE INTERNET*. [Here's the documentation for the `blogdown` package](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) if you want to know more about it. This post was written with R markdown and the blog itself was setup using `blogdown` and RStudio. 

That's all for now. Hope you enjoy the rest of the content here :)
