# Biography

My name is Pedro Ivo Guimarães and I am a Biological Systems Engineering PhD student at Virginia Tech. My research focus are the development of a process capable of converting any type of organic waste to high-value chemicals such as antibitics and the discovery and characterization of new antibiotic-producing microorganisms.

I am fascinated by Data Science and Statistics, and I really want to practice my skills on this field, so I started tis blog! This way I can unite my love for data science and my other interests, such as gaming and ESports and Biotechnology! Hope you enjoy the content here :)
