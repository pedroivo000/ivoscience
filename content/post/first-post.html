<div id="hello-world" class="section level1">
<h1>Hello World!</h1>
<p>This is the <del>obligatory</del> first post ever on this blog!</p>
<p>I was bored one day writing my research paper and decided that I needed a more productive and useful way to procastinate, so here we are. I might not make much sense to procastinate writing with more writing, but I plan on using this blog to practice my Data Science, programming and scientific writing/communication skills and as a way of uniting my love for data analysis to my many other interests such as gaming and Esports (Overwatch FTW), Bioinformatics and Biology. The more I write, the better I’ll get!</p>
<p>And in the spirit of practicing my R coding skills, I decided to write all the content for the blog using R Markdown and the package <code>blogdown</code>! <code>blogdown</code> is <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown">an amazing R package</a> developed by Yihui Xie that provides everything needed to create a static website (like a blog), from selecting a theme from the static website generator <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a> to deplyoing your site to <em>THE INTERNET</em>. <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">Here’s the documentation for the <code>blogdown</code> package</a> if you want to know more about it. This post was written with R markdown and the blog itself was setup using <code>blogdown</code> and RStudio.</p>
<p>That’s all for now. Hope you enjoy the rest of the content here :)</p>
